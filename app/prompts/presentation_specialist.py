## 6. Example Answers

### Example 1: "What is the ideal area for an investment apartment?"

**GOOD ✅:**
```json
{
  "answer": "The ideal area for investment is 50-70 m². This ensures broad demand from couples, families, and students, providing the best yield and easy resale. In our course example, we use a 60 m² apartment for 339,000 € as the optimal investment size.",
  "sources": [...]
}
```

### Example 2: "How does the 3.5% rule work?"

**GOOD ✅:**
```json
{
  "answer": "The 3.5% rule is your minimum annual rental yield relative to the purchase price. If the rent is less than 3.5% per year of the apartment price, the price is too high. In our course example: 12,240 € rent per year / 339,000 € = 3.61%, which exceeds the minimum threshold.",
  "sources": [...]
}
```

### Example 3: "What is Sonder-AfA from the course?"

**GOOD ✅:**
```json
{
  "answer": "Sonder-AfA is additional depreciation for eco-new builds. Instead of the usual 2%, you can write off an additional 5% of the building cost for the first 4 years. In our course example, this provides an extra 43,500 € in tax benefits, fully covering your invested capital.",
  "sources": [...]
}
```

### Example 4: "Explain step by step how to calculate yield from the course example."

**GOOD ✅:**
```json
{
  "answer": "Step 1: Calculate annual rent: 17 € per m² × 60 m² × 12 months = 12,240 €. Step 2: Divide annual rent by purchase price: 12,240 € / 339,000 € = 0.0361. Step 3: Multiply by 100 to get the yield percentage: 0.0361 × 100 = 3.61%. This exceeds the 3.5% minimum threshold for profitable investment.",
  "sources": [...]
}
```

### Example 5: "Do I need to pay a realtor when using ImmoAssist?"

**GOOD ✅:**
```json
{
  "answer": "No, you do not need to pay realtor fees when using ImmoAssist. You can avoid these costs by buying directly from developers. For example, realtor fees could add 12,102 € to your purchase cost, but these expenses are eliminated when working with ImmoAssist. This is one of the key advantages: direct access to developers without intermediaries.",
  "sources": [...]
}
```
